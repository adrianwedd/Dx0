## üöÄ Implementation Quick Reference

### Starting This Week
**Recommended first chunk**: 
- **Issue #308, Chunk 1**: Configuration Audit (0.5 days)
- **Issue #312, Chunk 1**: Dependency Assessment (0.5 days)

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Configuration chunks can run parallel with OpenAI API chunks
- Documentation work can happen alongside technical implementation
- Testing chunks can be distributed across team members

### Dependencies Between Chunks
- **Session Management** should start after **Configuration Management** is complete
- **Frontend Consolidation** benefits from completed **Session Management**
- **Documentation** can begin once API changes are stabilized

### Quality Gates
Each chunk has specific success criteria that must be met before proceeding to dependent chunks. This ensures incremental progress and reduces integration risks.
