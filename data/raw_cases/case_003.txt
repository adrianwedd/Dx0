Objective: Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are prescribed for a wide 
range of indications in women of reproductive age. The National Pregnancy 
Registry for Atypical Antipsychotics (NPRAA) was established to determine the 
risk of major malformations among infants exposed to these medications during 
the first trimester relative to a comparison group of unexposed infants of 
mothers with histories of psychiatric morbidity. Methods: Women, aged 18-45 
years, with histories of psychiatric illness were prospectively followed through 
pregnancy and during the postpartum period. Pediatric and maternal medical 
records were obtained and screened for evidence of major malformations. 
Potential cases were adjudicated by a dysmorphologist who was blinded to drug 
exposure.. Recruitment to the Registry, which is based at the Ammon-Pinizzotto 
Center for Women's Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), 
includes nationwide provider referral, self-referral, and advertisement through 
the MGH Center for Women's Mental Health website. Results: As of April 9, 2020, 
1,906 women had enrolled, including 889 in the exposure group and 1,017 
controls. A total of 1,311 women completed the study and were eligible for 
inclusion in the analysis. Medical records were obtained for 81.3% of 
participants. Among 640 live births in the exposure group, 16 (2.50%) had 
confirmed major malformations reported, and among 704 live births in the control 
group, 14 (1.99%) had confirmed major malformations reported. The estimated odds 
ratio for major malformations comparing exposed and unexposed infants was 1.48 
(95% CI, 0.625-3.517). Conclusions: Data from the Registry assessing SGAs as a 
class indicate that they are unlikely to have a major teratogenic effect. These 
findings provide pertinent information for women and their health care providers 
regarding decisions about atypical antipsychotic use during pregnancy. Trial
