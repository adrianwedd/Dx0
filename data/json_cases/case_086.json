      "text": "Trauma is an important matter of public health and a major cause of mortality. \nSince the late 1980s trauma care provision in the United Kingdom is lacking when \ncompared to the USA. This has been attributed to a lack of organisation of \ntrauma care leading to the formation of trauma networks and Major Trauma Centres \nin England and Wales. The need for similar centres in Scotland is argued \ncurrently. We assessed the activity of two quite different trauma systems by \nobtaining access to comparative data from two hospitals, one in the USA and the \nother in Scotland. Aggregate data on 5604 patients at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary \n(ARI) from 1993 to 2002 was obtained from the Scottish Trauma Audit Group. A \ncomparable data set of 16,178 patients from Massachusetts General Hospital \n(MGH). Direct comparison of patient demographics; injury type, mechanism and \nInjury Severity Score (ISS); mode of arrival; length of stay and mortality were \nmade. Statistical analysis was carried out using Chi-squared and \nCochran-Mantel-Haenszel. There were significant differences in the data sets. \nThere was a higher proportion of penetrating injuries at MGH, (8.6% vs 2.6%) and \nmore severely injured patients at MGH, patients with an ISS>16 accounted for \nnearly 22.1% of MGH patients compared to 14.0% at ARI. ISS 8-15 made up 54.6% of \nARI trauma with 29.6% at MGH. Falls accounted for 50.1% at ARI and 37.9% at MGH. \nDespite the higher proportion of severe injuries at MGH and crude mortality \nrates showing no difference (4.9% ARI vs 5.2% MGH), pooled odds ratio of \nmortality was 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.2-1.6) showing worse mortality \noutcomes at ARI compared to MGH. In conclusion, there were some differences in \ncase mix between both data sets making direct comparison of the outcomes \ndifficult, but the effect of consolidating major trauma on the proportion and \nnumber of severely injured patients treated in the American Level 1 centre was \nclear with a significant improvement in mortality in all injury severity groups."
