      "text": "Objective: Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are prescribed for a wide \nrange of indications in women of reproductive age. The National Pregnancy \nRegistry for Atypical Antipsychotics (NPRAA) was established to determine the \nrisk of major malformations among infants exposed to these medications during \nthe first trimester relative to a comparison group of unexposed infants of \nmothers with histories of psychiatric morbidity. Methods: Women, aged 18-45 \nyears, with histories of psychiatric illness were prospectively followed through \npregnancy and during the postpartum period. Pediatric and maternal medical \nrecords were obtained and screened for evidence of major malformations. \nPotential cases were adjudicated by a dysmorphologist who was blinded to drug \nexposure.. Recruitment to the Registry, which is based at the Ammon-Pinizzotto \nCenter for Women's Mental Health at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), \nincludes nationwide provider referral, self-referral, and advertisement through \nthe MGH Center for Women's Mental Health website. Results: As of April 9, 2020, \n1,906 women had enrolled, including 889 in the exposure group and 1,017 \ncontrols. A total of 1,311 women completed the study and were eligible for \ninclusion in the analysis. Medical records were obtained for 81.3% of \nparticipants. Among 640 live births in the exposure group, 16 (2.50%) had \nconfirmed major malformations reported, and among 704 live births in the control \ngroup, 14 (1.99%) had confirmed major malformations reported. The estimated odds \nratio for major malformations comparing exposed and unexposed infants was 1.48 \n(95% CI, 0.625-3.517). Conclusions: Data from the Registry assessing SGAs as a \nclass indicate that they are unlikely to have a major teratogenic effect. These \nfindings provide pertinent information for women and their health care providers \nregarding decisions about atypical antipsychotic use during pregnancy. Trial \nRegistration: ClinicalTrails.gov identifier: NCT01246765."
