      "text": "The low glycemic index treatment, a dietary therapy that focuses on glycemic \nindex and reduced carbohydrate intake, has been successful in reducing seizure \nfrequency in the general epilepsy population. Epilepsy is a common feature of \nAngelman syndrome and seizures are often refractory to multiple medications, \nespecially in those with maternal deletions. Dietary therapy has become a more \nfrequently used option for treating epilepsy, often in combination with other \nantiepileptic drugs, due to its efficacy and favorable side effect profile. This \nstudy aimed to assess the effectiveness of the low glycemic index treatment for \nseizure control in Angelman syndrome. Through a retrospective medical record \nreview of 23 subjects who utilized the low glycemic index treatment at the \nClinic and Center for Dietary Therapy of Epilepsy at the Massachusetts General \nHospital, we found that the high level of seizure control and favorable side \neffect profile make the low glycemic index treatment a viable treatment for \nseizures in Angelman syndrome. The majority of subjects in our cohort \nexperienced some level of seizure reduction after initiating the diet, 5 (22%) \nmaintained complete seizure freedom, 10 (43%) maintained seizure freedom except \nin the setting of illness or non-convulsive status epilepticus, 7 (30%) had a \ndecrease in seizure frequency, and only 1 (4%) did not have enough information \nto determine seizure control post-initiation. The low glycemic index treatment \nmonotherapy was successful for some subjects in our cohort but most subjects \nused an antiepileptic drug concurrently. Some subjects were able to maintain the \nsame level of seizure control on a liberalized version of the low glycemic index \ntreatment which included a larger amount of low glycemic carbohydrates. No \ncorrelation between the level of carbohydrate restriction and level of seizure \ncontrol was found. Few subjects experienced side effects and those that did \nfound them to be mild and easily treated. The efficacy of the low glycemic index \ntreatment and its favorable side effect profile make it an excellent alternative \nor supplement to antiepileptic drug therapy for the treatment of seizures in \nAngelman syndrome."
