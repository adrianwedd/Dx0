# Drift Analysis Report

- **Expansion toward CLI docs** – The latest merge introduced Sphinx-based documentation for the command line, as shown by the new instructions in `README.md` lines 438‑447 and a new backlog item in `tasks.yml` lines 1760‑1769. This aligns with prior goals of improving documentation.
- **Integration of Sphinx framework** – `docs/README.md` now details how to build CLI docs using `sphinx-build`, while new Sphinx configuration files (e.g., `docs/sphinx/conf.py` and `docs/sphinx/index.rst`) show intentional setup for structured documentation. No conflicting instructions found, so drift is minimal.
- **Roadmap adherence** – The backlog entry describing Sphinx CLI docs is marked `status: done`, indicating the roadmap is being updated alongside development. This demonstrates consistency between tasks and implementation.

## Decision Audit Ledger

- **Decision:** Add Sphinx-based CLI documentation
  - **Origin:** Commit introducing `docs/sphinx` structure and README update
  - **Justified by:** Tasks.yml entry (#212) designating CLI docs as an enhancement
  - **Breaks down if:** Sphinx dependencies aren’t installed or docs aren’t regenerated with later CLI updates

- **Decision:** Introduce `sphinx-typer` and `myst-parser` dependencies
  - **Origin:** Same commit updating `requirements-dev.txt`
  - **Justified by:** Needed for Typer-based CLI docs generation
  - **Breaks down if:** Future CLI changes aren’t reflected in docs or if these packages conflict with other tooling

## Trajectory Assessment

- **Convergent path** – The project is slowly consolidating around better documentation and structured evaluation. The tasks backlog is consistently updated.
- **Risks** – New features may stretch maintenance if not continually documented, and expanding dependencies might complicate the build environment.
- **Futures:**
  1. **Stable release** – With ongoing cleanup and documentation, the system packages into a reproducible distribution.
  2. **Complexity creep** – Additional features without cross-task alignment cause tests and docs to drift, undermining reliability.
  3. **Architectural pivot** – A shift to new LLM providers or decision engines introduces unplanned refactors; success hinges on clear design docs.

## Schema & Structural Integrity Checks

- `tasks.yml` continues to track IDs, titles, descriptions, statuses, and priorities consistently; new items follow the schema.
- Docs are organized under `docs/` with a dedicated Sphinx subdirectory, which matches README instructions.
- CLI documentation references the Typer app correctly via `.. typer:: cli.app` in `cli_reference.rst`.

## Recommendations for Realignment

1. **Automate doc generation** – Add a CI step to run `sphinx-build` to ensure CLI docs stay up to date with every release.
2. **Cross-reference tasks and docs** – Link relevant tasks directly in the documentation so contributors see how features map to roadmap items.
3. **Test coverage** – Ensure any new CLI options are reflected in tests; otherwise the CLI docs risk becoming aspirational rather than accurate.
