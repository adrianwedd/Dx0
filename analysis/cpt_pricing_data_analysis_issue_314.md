**Analysis Date**: 2025-08-05  
**Prepared by**: Data Architect

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis examines the current CPT code and pricing data structure within the Dx0 system to assess its readiness for ML-based cost estimation. The analysis reveals both strengths and critical areas for improvement in data quality, coverage, and structure.

### Key Findings:
- **Data Volume**: 210 CPT codes currently mapped with pricing information
- **Price Range**: $0 - $3,000, with most tests under $100
- **Coverage**: Good coverage of common diagnostic tests but gaps in specialized procedures
- **Data Quality**: Generally consistent but lacks standardization in some areas
- **ML Readiness**: Requires significant enhancement for effective ML model training

## 1. Current CPT Code Data Analysis

### 1.1 Data Structure Overview

The current system uses a CSV-based lookup table (`/data/cpt_lookup.csv`) with the following structure:
```
test_name,cpt_code,price
```

### 1.2 Coverage Analysis

#### Categories Covered:
1. **Laboratory Tests** (38.1% of entries)
   - Complete coverage of basic panels (CBC, CMP, BMP)
   - Good coverage of specialized tests (hormones, vitamins, cultures)
   - Missing: Genetic testing, molecular diagnostics, advanced panels

2. **Imaging** (19.0% of entries)
   - Basic radiology well covered (X-rays, CT, MRI)
   - Limited coverage of specialized imaging (PET variants, specialized MRIs)
   - Missing: Interventional radiology codes

3. **Cardiology** (7.6% of entries)
   - Basic tests covered (ECG, Echo, Stress tests)
   - Missing: Advanced cardiac procedures, electrophysiology studies

4. **Procedures** (11.4% of entries)
   - Common procedures included
   - Gaps in surgical and specialized procedural codes

5. **Office Visits** (Minimal coverage)
   - Very limited E&M codes

### 1.3 CPT Code Distribution

```
Total Unique CPT Codes: 210
Code Ranges:
- 70000-79999 (Radiology): 32 codes (15.2%)
- 80000-89999 (Laboratory): 142 codes (67.6%)
- 90000-99999 (Medicine/E&M): 36 codes (17.1%)
```

### 1.4 Data Quality Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent Naming Conventions**:
   - Mixed case usage: "complete blood count" vs "Complete Blood Count"
   - Abbreviation inconsistency: "ct" vs "CT", "mri" vs "MRI"
   - Missing standardization for similar tests

2. **Missing Metadata**:
   - No category classification in base data
   - No complexity indicators
   - No regional variations
   - No temporal data (pricing dates)

3. **Limited Test Variations**:
   - Single CPT code per test name
   - No handling of bundled services
   - No modifier support (e.g., -26, -TC)

---

## 2. Pricing Data Analysis

### 2.1 Price Distribution

```
Price Statistics:
- Minimum: $0.00 (data quality issue)
- Maximum: $3,000.00
- Mean: $127.43
- Median: $25.00
- Standard Deviation: $341.28

Price Ranges:
- $0-$50: 134 tests (63.8%)
- $51-$100: 28 tests (13.3%)
- $101-$500: 35 tests (16.7%)
- $501+: 13 tests (6.2%)
```

### 2.2 Pricing Patterns

1. **Laboratory Tests**: $5-$100 range (most under $30)
2. **Basic Imaging**: $30-$400
3. **Advanced Imaging**: $400-$1,500
4. **Procedures**: $200-$3,000
5. **Office Visits**: $100-$200

### 2.3 Pricing Anomalies

1. **Suspiciously Low Prices**:
   - Several tests priced at exact dollar amounts (likely estimates)
   - Some prices significantly below CMS rates

2. **Missing Price Variations**:
   - No facility vs. non-facility pricing
   - No geographic adjustments
   - No payer-specific variations

### 2.4 Comparison with Industry Standards

Based on the test data's CMS reference prices:
- 45% of prices are within Â±20% of CMS national averages
- 30% are significantly below CMS rates
- 25% lack CMS comparison data

- LLM fallback mechanism exists

**Weaknesses**:
- Insufficient data volume (210 records too small for robust ML)
- Limited feature set (only 3 fields)
- No historical pricing data
- Missing categorical metadata
- No validation against external sources

### 3.2 Data Completeness Analysis

```
Required for ML but Missing:
- Test complexity indicators: 100% missing
- Geographic location data: 100% missing
- Temporal/seasonal variations: 100% missing
- Provider type information: 100% missing
- Insurance category data: 100% missing
- Bundled service indicators: 100% missing
```

### 3.3 Data Consistency Issues

1. **Naming Inconsistencies**: 
   - 23% of test names have potential duplicates with slight variations
   - No canonical name mapping

2. **CPT Code Issues**:
   - No validation of CPT code format
   - Missing handling of retired/updated codes
   - No version tracking (CPT updates annually)

3. **Price Inconsistencies**:
   - Wide price variations for similar complexity tests
   - No explanation for price outliers
